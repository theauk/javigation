# Javigation
A mapping and navigation program built with the Java programming language.

## Usage

### Via the terminal with arguments
* Navigate to the project directory in the terminal/command prompt.
* Run `java -Xmx8g -jar javigation.jar`
* The program can also be executed only with 6g. However, for bigger maps (such as the map of Denmark) 8g makes the program run more efficiently.

### Via the terminal without arguments
* Navigate to the project directory in the terminal/command prompt.
* Run `java -jar javigation.jar`
* When the file chooser opens, press cancel to load the default binary file (Fyn).

### Via the file manager
* Double click the app.jar icon.
* Bigger maps (such as the map of Denmark) should be opened via the terminal/command prompt.

## Tests
* The JUnit tests can be found in the test folder located inside app/src.
