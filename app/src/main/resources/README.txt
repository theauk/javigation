Welcome to Javigaition - a navigation program built with the Java programming language

To run the program with big maps like the map of Denmark it will need to be executed
with the following command in the command line:
        java -Xmx8g -jar app.jar
    it can be executed with -Xmx6g too, but it's more efficient to run the program with -Xmx8g
