# Javigation
A mapping and navigation program built with the Java programming language.

## Usage

### Via the terminal
* Navigate to the project directory in the terminal/command line.
* Run `java -Xmx8g -jar app.jar`
* The program can also be executed only with 6g. However, for bigger maps (such as the map of Denmark) 8g makes the program run more efficiently.

### Via the file manager
* Double click the app.jar icon.
